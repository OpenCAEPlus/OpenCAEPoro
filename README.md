OpenCAEPoro or OCP is part of the [OpenCAEPlus](https://opencaeplus.org/) project. OCP, written in C++, focuses on simulating multicomponent multiphase flows in porous media. For more information, please refer to [OCP repository](https://opencaeplus.github.io/OpenCAEPoro/).

## Get Started

For user manual and API's (class references from Doxygen), see [website](https://porous.opencaeplus.org).

For full documentation generated by Doxygen, see [here](https://opencaeplus.github.io/OpenCAEPoro/).

## Install

There is a top level cmake configuration file to build the OpenCAEPoro lib and the associate test program suite. You can use a cmake-style approach to compile the package; see [the official webpage](https://cmake.org) on how to use cmake for your own operating system and tool chain.

> Before building OpenCAEPoro, you need to make sure that VTK, BLAS, LAPACK, and FASP are available. VTK, BLAS and LAPACK are ready on most systems and can be found by cmake automatically. The FASP package (open-source) can be downloaded from its GitHub repository [faspsolver](https://github.com/FaspDevTeam/faspsolver). More solver options are provided in [faspcpr](https://github.com/FaspDevTeam/faspcpr) and [fasp4blkoil](https://github.com/FaspDevTeam/fasp4blkoil).

The typical command for compiling OpenCAEPoro is:

**Step 1a.** Config the environment for building with cmake:

```bash
  >>> mkdir Build; cd Build
  >>> cmake ..
```

**Step 1b.** If you need solvers in fasp4blkoil and UMFPACK, for example, run the following instead:

```bash
  >>> mkdir Build; cd Build
  >>> cmake -DUSE_FASP4BLKOIL=ON -DUSE_UMFPACK=ON ..
```

> For other supported external packages, please refer to the `CMakeLists.txt` file.

**Step 2a.** To build the library as well as examples without installing it, run:

```bash
  >>> make
```

**Step 2b.** To make the library and then install it, run:

```bash
  >>> make install
```

Standard `uninstall` and `clean` targets are also provided in the generated Makefile. You may safely remove the `Build` directory as well.

Note: You can also use the provided scripts to build the whole project:

```bash
  >>> chmod 755 cli
  >>> ./cli build -c intel -t all -b Debug 
```

> You may change the arguments for your own setting. For example, change `Debug` to `Release` for a release build.

## Structure

The directory structure of OpenCAEPoro is designed as follows:

- `data/` : Output files for comparison purposes
- `doc/` : Documentation website
- `examples/` : Input files for test examples
- `external/` : External dependencies
- `include/` : Header files
- `src/` : Source files
- `stash/` : Files that are no longer needed, keep for future references
- `main/` : Main source code for executables
- CMakeLists.txt: Main cmake script
- CMakePresets.json: Preset settings for cmake
- CONTRIBUTE.md: Guidance for open source contributors
- LICENSE: License agreement
- README.md: This document
- cli, cli.bat: Command line interface for build, test, and doc
- .clang-format: For automatic source code formatting

## Test

There are three levels of tests:

- Unit test: for testing individual code components
- Integrate test: for testing interfaces between components
- System test: for testing and benchmark of the whole program  

Currently, only system tests are provided in the `examples/` folder.
